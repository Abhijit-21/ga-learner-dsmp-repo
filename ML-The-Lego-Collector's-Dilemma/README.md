### Project Overview

 Problem statement : 
You are a die hard Lego enthusiast wishing to collect as many board sets as you can. But before that you wish to be able to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that you can budget it from your revenue. Since (luckily!), you are a data scientist in the making, you wished to solve this problem yourself. This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. Your aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.

About the Dataset:
The Data folder contains the dataset with details of 12261 lego sets and the 10 features. 







### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have the better understanding of how to build a linear regression model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

- Train-test split
- Correlation between the features
- Linear Regression
- MSE 
- R_2 Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project , we check the features which highly correlated with the target variable list_price by using scatter plot.After that we reduce feature redundancies. Using linear regression to predict the price. We checked the model accuracy using r^2 score and mse.Based on the distance between the true target y_test and predicted target y_pred, also known as the residual the cost function is defined. Let's look at the residual and visualize the errors in the model.
