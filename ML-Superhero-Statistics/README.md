### Project Overview

 Superhero Statistics:
The rise of superheroes and supervillains is at an all time high. The 'Academy of Super Beings(ASB)' was formed to bring order to it. We have with us the data of more than 500 super humans but we need use knowledge of descriptive statistics in figuring out the important insights from it.

About the Dataset 
The snapshot of the data, you will be working upon:

The dataset has details of 594 super hero characters with the  17 features.



### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better grip on the applications of descriptive statistics. In this project, you will be applying the following concepts:

- Bar plotting
- Boxplot plotting
- Pie-chart plotting
- Subplot operations
- Feature Correlation
- IQR operations


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project we figure out the important insights from data by using descriptive statistics fundamentals.First we load the give data set to do any sort of descriptive statistics. W erepalce the unwanted symbols like '-' by name and plot the Bar graphs to understand the gender count.Aslo we plot the pie chart to understand what's the stand of the members of 'ASB'. Does good overpower evil or does evil overwhelm good? For any of the members, combat skills are really important to survive when they find themselves in unwanted situtations. But does combat relate to person's strength or it's intelligence? To overcum with this we find out the Pearson's Correlation for Strength and Combat and Pearson's Correlation for Intelligence and Combat.Also we found the Overpowered Super Beings.We plot the Statistics for Survival using box plot.

Key Skills Covered - Python, Data Wrangling, Visualization, Probability and Statistics
