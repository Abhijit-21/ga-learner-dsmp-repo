### Project Overview

 Problem Statement:
What is the probability that the borrower paid back their loan in full?

For this project, we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.

### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of probability. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

- Independency check
- Bayes theorem
- Visualizing discrete variable
- Visualizing continuous variable


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project we used the Bayes theorem for the probability of credit policy is yes and the person is given the loan. After that we visualize the bar plot for Purpose vs paid back loan.Also we plot the histogram for visualization of the continuous variable. So that we will get the basic idea about how the distribution of continuous variables looks like.
