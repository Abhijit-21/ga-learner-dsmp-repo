### Project Overview

 Problem statement : We are going to predict the Insurance claim using logistic regression.

About the Dataset :  The Data folder contains the dataset with details of 1338 Insurance claim and the 18 features.



### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to build a logistic regression model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

- Train-test split
- Correlation between the features
- Logistic Regression
- Auc score
- Roc AUC plot


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The dataset contains information on the insurance claim. each observation is different policyholder with various features like the age of the person, the gender of the policyholder, body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, number of children of the policyholder, smoking state of the policyholder and individual medical costs billed by health insurance.After data preprocessing and feature engineering we predict the Insurance claim using logistic regression.
