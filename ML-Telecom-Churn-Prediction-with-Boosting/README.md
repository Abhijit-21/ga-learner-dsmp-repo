### Project Overview

 Problem statement :  Using the method of Boosting, classify whether or not the customer will churn

About the Dataset : Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.Telephone service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.

Predictive analytics use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.

For this project we will be exploring the dataset of a telecom company and try to predict the customer churn.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to build a boosting model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

- Handling missing values in data
- Applying AdaBoost
- Applying XGBoost
- Interpreting evaluation metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 We laod the data set and clean it.After that replace the missing values and modify some column values.We use AdaBoostClassifier model for finding model accuracy.Also we implement XGBoost for our customer churn problem and checked how it performs in comparision to AdaBoost. The score of XGBoost is very close to the AdaBoost score(~0.001).
