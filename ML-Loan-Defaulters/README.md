### Project Overview

 Problem statement : Using Decision Tree model, classify whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.

About the Dataset : For this project we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.The data that we have is from 2007-2010.




### Approach taken to solve the problem

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to build a decision tree model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

- Train-test split
- Correlation between the features
- Decision Tree Modeling
- Evaluation Metrics
- Graphviz plotting


### Challenges faced

 First we load the data set and drop the some column which is not usefull for prediction.We did the feature engineering and we will split the features based on the data type for visualization purposes.We did the Visualisation for both Numerical and Categorical Features.We calculated the model accuracy using decision tree model.We checked  if pruning of decision tree improves its accuracy.We used grid search to do the optimum pruning and model accuaracy was incresed.Also we checked the pruned decision tree looks like using graphviz.
